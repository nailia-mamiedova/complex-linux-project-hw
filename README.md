This project consist of two simple programs:
1. **calculator**: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
2. **formater**: A program that formats strings to lowercase or uppercase.

In first program, I use static library and in second program I use dynamic library.

## Calculator

To run the calculator program, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the calculator directory**: Change into the calculator directory using:
    ```bash
    cd first_task/
    ```
2. **Build the library**: Use the following command to build the static library:
    ```bash
    make library
    ```
3. **Build the calculator**: Use the following command to build the calculator program:
    ```bash
    make main
    ```
4. **Run the calculator**: After building, you can run the calculator program using:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```
5. **Clean up**: To clean up the build files, you can use:
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

## Formater

To run the formater program, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the formater directory**: Change into the formater directory using:
    ```bash
    cd second_task/
    ```
2. **Build the library**: Use the following command to build the dynamic library:
    ```bash
    make library
    ```
3. **Build the formater**: Use the following command to build the formater program:
    ```bash
    make main
    ```
4. **Run the formater**: After building, you can run the formater program using:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```
5. **Clean up**: To clean up the build files, you can use:
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
